# Aquifer monitoring system for arduino YÃºn
The system uses a pressure sensor (Freescale MPX5010) to read the level of an aquifer and to trigger two pumps when the level exceeds a certain threshold. It also includes a webapp that displays the collected data and the actual status of the system (Pumps, sensors etc...).
